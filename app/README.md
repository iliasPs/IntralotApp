## Ilias Paraskevopoulos - Intralot Job Candidate submission

This project contains the full implementations of a basic application for the android platform,
demonstrating basic code designing using the Clean Architecture pattern, which offers an easy way to scale apps.
A simple project that requests over HTTP a request and receives a JSON list of Github Projects.

I took the liberty to alternate the initial screen and add a second screen where we can see the project details (description, permissions etc)

## Clean Architecture basic features

- Extends the MVVM pattern
- Separation of concerns
- Includes the Business logic over the Model-View-ViewModel pattern, which is Use Cases
    - Use Cases show the intent of the software.
- Clean architecture contains 3 layers:
    - Presentation (UI)
    - Domain (Models, Repository interfaces, business logic)
    - Data (Api interface, db, repository implementations)

## Purpose of this app

Using Clean architecture for this app, is a kind of an "overkill", but it shows that the app is easily scalable and
I demonstrate those skills.
